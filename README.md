# AXE (version 4.4.3) integration with Cypress 10.4 JavaScript

This is a Cypress JavaScript project with the dependencies:
- Cypress 10.4.0
- Axe-Core 4.4.3
- Cypress-Axe 1.0.0

With AXE 4.0 onwards, the whole library changed and it become more easier to do things :) The syntax and the method names of the AXE-Core library changed when compare to versions before 4.0! This sample project includes codes with the latest (4.4.3 as of today) version of AXE Core library.

## How to run the code:
1. Open the projet with IntelliJ (or any other preferred IDE)
2. Run 'npm install' to download the dependencies in the package.json file
3. Run 'npx cypress open' to open the Cypress GUI
4. Click the test you want to run
